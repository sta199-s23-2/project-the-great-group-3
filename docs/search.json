The data originally started being collected in 2019.\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nThe observations are individual matches from all club soccer matches since 2022, with the exception of the Chinese Super League’s 2019 season. The columns describe FiveThirtyEight’s predictions for each match and then the result of the match. FiveThirtyEight uses their SPI model as predictions, then the data set included expected goals and goals scored for each team."

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nHow accurately does FiveThirtyEight’s projected goals scored predict actual goals scored depending on league?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nMy research topic relates how well FiveThirtyEight can predict the results of each match in each league. In short, I’m looking for which leagues are the most and least predictable. If FiveThirtyEight’s predictions are consistently accurate for a league, that league could be considered relatively predictable. To quantify the results, I’m planning on using projected goals scored with actual goals scored. My hypotheses is that higher quality leagues, such as the English Premier League, La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League are the most predictable as those leagues have the largest discrepancies of talent based on club.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nCategorical variables include: League, Team1, and Team2\nQuantitative variables include: Date, League ID, spi1, spi2, prob1, prob2, probtie, importance1, importance2, score1, score2, xg1, xg2, nsxg1, nsxg2, adj_score1, adj_score2"
