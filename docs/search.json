In short, I’m looking for which leagues are the most and least predictable. If FiveThirtyEight’s predictions are consistently accurate for a league, that league could be considered relatively predictable. To quantify the results, I’m planning on using projected goals scored with actual goals scored. My hypotheses is that higher quality leagues, such as the English Premier League, La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League are the most predictable as those leagues have the largest discrepancies of talent based on club.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nCategorical variables include: League, Team1, and Team2\nQuantitative variables include: Date, League ID, spi1, spi2, prob1, prob2, probtie, importance1, importance2, score1, score2, xg1, xg2, nsxg1, nsxg2, adj_score1, adj_score2"

Across all divisions of NCAA sports, the funding for both men’s and women’s sports has doubled over the past decade. However, the largest gap can be observed in division 1 sports. On average, Universities spend, approximately, double on their men’s teams than they do on their women’s teams. It is important to note, however, that this is largely skewed by the schools with football teams (although that is most). Schools without football teams spend almost the same ($5 million each). The gap is largest in schools with top tier football teams. Taking that factor into account, in 2015, schools spent an estimated $27.3 million on men’s sports and about $10.5 million on their women’s teams\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nOur project builds upon the information provided in the article because, it not only adds the differentiating factor of states, but it builds on the idea of the gender gap in recruitment budgets by attempting to create a model that can predict such gaps based upon the allocation of aid towards each gender of athlete."

Most famously known for their Men’s Division 1 Basketball and Football teams, as of 2020, Duke makes an estimated $33,382,946 and $39,669,829 in revenue, respectively (Laster, Jordan, et al. “The Haves and the Have-Nots: Inequities Amongst Duke University’s Sports Teams.” The Haves and the Have-Nots: Inequities Amongst Duke University’s Sports Teams | Black In Blue, 2020, https://blackinblue.trinity.duke.edu/haves-and-have-nots-inequities-amongst-duke-universitys-sports-teams.). Furthermore, Duke spends approximately $1,329,949 per Men’s basketball player and $217,047 per football player (Ibid.). Duke’s 2020 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) revealed that Duke spent a total of $57,114,331 on men’s sports teams and a total of $25,472,405 on women’s sports teams (Ibid.) This figure includes recruitment cost, amongst other things. Nationwide, there is a recorded inequity between NCAA sports (Meredith, L. (2017, June 21). NCAA Title IX Report: Spending up, gender gaps remain. The Seattle Times. https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/ncaa-title-ix-report-spending-up-gender-gaps-remain/). As Duke students, we were curious: is this the status quo in collegiate athletics?\nThe Dataset\nThe dataset we use to explore this topic comes from the U.S. Department of Education’s Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, which requires many schools to provide information regarding financial expenditure and revenue generation of their athletics departments. The dataset spans 4274 variables, including school names, locations, and cost breakdowns. There are 1844 observations in this dataset; each observation is a different school. The most recently published dataset is from 2021, which is the dataset we use.\nExplanation of Topic\nOur topic will specifically observe and investigate how much, on average, universities spend on recruitment. We will create a model that predicts this figure, based on the current a university’s expenditure on athletic scholarships for student athletes. We will break down a number of variables within the data, looking at whether the institution is public versus private, has a football program or not, and what athletic division it falls under (I, II, or III) The reason we chose these variables are as follows: (1) the monetary means of public institutions have a wide range – larger and older private schools often having more means, while samller private schools and public schools having less; (2) through the research for our literature review, it was found that the largest spending gap on sports occurred in schools that had a football program versus schools without a football program, schools with football often spending over $5 million more on sports programs; (3) division matters a great deal when considering expenditure on sports, with division I schools often allocating far more than division II and III (Desrochers, D. M. (2013, January). Academic spending vs. athletic spending: Who wins? . Delta Cost Project. Retrieved from https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/ report/Academic-Spending-vs-Athletic-Spending.pdf ). Our research question is: To what extent can college athletics’ recruitment funds be predicted by the level of athletic scholarships provided to student athletes? We hypothesize that the ratio will, to a high degree, predict the recruitment funding — as schools who allocate more money into students’ financial aid will be willing to designate more money for their recruitment.\nEthical Issues\nThere are very few ethical issues anticipated with this investigation. However, it is important to note that source biases are a likely phenomenon. We must be careful with many self-reported information from university sites, and assuring that the data published can be verified. An additional bias concern is disproportionately represented data. The data could represent certain regions or types of schools, which could skew the results. Transparency of the data is also an ethical concern to note. It is important that the data is transparently presented, and that the methods used to analyze the data are clearly explained. This will help ensure that the findings are trustworthy and can be used for the intended purpose. Lastly, the accuracy of the data is a possible ethical issue. It is possible that the data in the dataset is inaccurate or incomplete, which could lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions being made based on the data. These are the possible ethical issues that have been noted in the investigation.\nMethodology\nResearch question: To what extent can college athletics’ recruitment funds be predicted by the level of athletic scholarships provided to student athletes?\n\nPrivate vs. public\nFootball vs. no football\nDivision\n\nWe will answer our research question by first creating subsets of our data by the factors listed above, and removing any outliers using the interquartile range rule. Then we create regression models comparing athletic scholarships to recruitment funds, and then calculate the AIC for each model to determine the effectiveness of each predictor. We chose to use regression models because our research question looks at the extent to which one variable can predict another. We chose to use AIC calculations because we are comparing the effectiveness of prediction based on which variables are included in the model, and AIC is an effective calculation for comparing models that is not simply dependent on the number of predictors.\n\neada_NCAA <- eada |>\n  filter(classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FCS\" | \n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FBS\" | \n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division I without football\" |\n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division II with football\" |\n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division II without football\" | \n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division III with football\" |\n        classification_name == \"NCAA Division III without football\")\n\n\nQ1_NCAA_ep <- quantile(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_ep, .25)\nQ1_NCAA_sa <- quantile(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_sa, .25)\n\nQ3_NCAA_ep <- quantile(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_ep, .75)\nQ3_NCAA_sa <- quantile(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_sa, .75)\n\nIQR_NCAA_ep <- IQR(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_ep)\nIQR_NCAA_sa <- IQR(eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_sa)\n\neada_NCAA <- subset(eada_NCAA, eada_NCAA$ratio_mw_ep> \n                      (Q1_NCAA_ep -

Below, we wrangled our data set to create three new variables, school_type(private or public), football(football or no football), and division (one, two, or three). Then, we fit our multivariate prediction model.\n\neada_wrangled <- eada_no_outs |>\n  mutate(division = case_when(\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FCS\" ~ \"one\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FBS\" ~ \"one\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I without football\" ~ \"one\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division II with football\" ~ \"two\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division II without football\" ~ \"two\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division III without football\" ~ \"three\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division III without football\" ~ \"three\")) |>\n  mutate(football = case_when(\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I without football\" ~ \"no football\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division II without football\" ~ \"no football\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division III without football\" ~ \"no football\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FCS\" ~ \"football\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division I-FBS\" ~ \"football\",\n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division II with football\" ~ \"football\", \n    classification_name == \"NCAA Division III with football\" ~ \"football\")) |>\n  mutate(school_type = case_when(\n    sector_name == \"Public, 4-year or above\" ~ \"public\",\n    sector_name == \"Public, 2-year\" ~ \"public\",\n    sector_name == \"Private nonprofit, 4-year or above\" ~ \"private\", \n    sector_name == \"Private for-profit, 4-year or above\" ~ \"private\"))\n\n\nmodel <- linear_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"lm\") |>\n  fit(ratio_mw_ep ~ school_type + division + football + ratio_mw_sa, \n      data = eada_wrangled) |>\n  tidy()\n\n\\(\\hat{ratio\\_mw\\_ep} = 3.688 -0.651({school\\_type}) - 0.829({division\\_three}) - .848({division\\_two}) - 1.592({no\\_football}) + 0.086({ratio\\_mw\\_sa})\\)\nOur model predicts that private, division one football schools have the highest ratio of male to female recruitment funds. Further, whether a school has football holds the highest weight as an influencing factor. Further, the model displays that there is a slight positive correlation between a higher male to female student aid ratio and a higher male to female recruitment fund ratio.\nResults\nThis prediction model was aimed at testing whether the financial allocation universities spent on athletic scholarship could predict the amount they allocated for recruitment. We filtered the data through three different variables: whether the school had a football program or not, whether the school was public or private, and whether the school was Division I, II, or III. Notably, many of these groups did not have equal numbers of schools, and division 3 is only 9 schools.\nIt is important to note the biases that may have effected the data outcome. Division III schools do not allocate any money towards athletic scholarships. Furthermore, financial capabilities widely vary between public and private schools, as well as, how much income the school makes from their athletic programs.\nAfter filtering the data, we ran an AIC metric on all the subsets of the data to compare the different regression models. There was a more accurate trend observed in the private vs. public data-set, meaning that model offers the best fit. Amongst all the graphs, there is a low positive correlation observed. Then we ran an R squared test. This would tell us the significance in the correlation between the two variables: scholarship funds versus recruitment funds. The R squared test revealed that there is a very insignificant correlation between the two chosen variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\nAll Schools\nAll Schools Outliers Removed\nPrivate Schools\nPublic Schools\n\n\nAIC:\n7723.431\n7409.35\n490.849\n869.687\n\n\nR Square:\n0.008\n0.003\n0.112\n0.082\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData:\nFootball Schools\nNo Football Schools\nDI Schools\nDII Schools\nDIII Schools\n\n\nAIC:\n2484.094\n374.648\n1167.375\n554.459\n-1.120\n\n\nR Square:\n0.079\n0.025\n0.103\n0.127\n0.039\n\n\n\nWithout filtering the data at all and not faceting the data by any groups, there is a 0.008 correlation between the two variables. This shows that it is incredibly low positive correlation. Additionally, There is an AIC of 7723.431. After filtering the data and removing outliers, we see that the AIC decreased, indicating that removing the outliers reduced the variability in the data, and that the data was better fit after removing outliers.\nSomething about a negative AIC?? Something about low correlation."
