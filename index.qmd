**Abstract**

This report investigates the extent to which the male to female ratio of athletic scholarships can predict the male to female ratio of recruitment funds. We aimed to create a prediction model between the former and the latter. Using data collected from the U.S. Department of Education's Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, we applied the prediction model to the variables of public versus private institutions, football versus no football program, and the division of the school (I, II, or III), attempting to observe whether there was a relationship between scholarships and recruitment. Our overall findings were that there were little to no correlations between the variables, and it is not recommended to use expenditure athletic scholarships to predict recruitment funds given to men and women's sports.
