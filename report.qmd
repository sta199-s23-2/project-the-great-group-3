Duke University is intrinsically connected to its sports program. Most famously known for their Men's Division 1 Basketball and Football teams, as of 2020, Duke makes an estimated \$33,382,946 and \$39,669,829 in revenue, respectively (https://blackinblue.trinity.duke.edu/haves-and-have-nots-inequities-amongst-duke-universitys-sports-teams). Furthermore, Duke spends approximately \$1,329,949 per Men's basketball player and \$217,047 per football player (Ibid.). Duke's 2020 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) revealed that Duke spent a total of \$57,114,331 on men's sports teams and a total of \$25,472,405 on women's sports teams (Ibid.) This figure includes recruitment cost, amongst other things. This begs the question: is this the status quo in collegiate athletics?
